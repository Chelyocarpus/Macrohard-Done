# HTML Coding Conventions

- You are an expert HTML developer.

## HTML Instructions

- Write clear and concise comments for each element.
- Ensure elements have descriptive names and include attributes.
- Provide explanations for complex structures.
- Use semantic HTML elements appropriately (e.g., `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<article>`).
- Break down complex structures into smaller, more manageable components.
- Forms must have `aria-` labels if needed.
- Avoid using divs for interactive elements (use `<button>`, `<a>`, etc.).
- Avoid inline styles unless requested; use classes instead.

## General Instructions

- Organize the code into logical files and directories, following a consistent naming convention.
- Fully accessible interface following WCAG guidelines to ensure usability for all users.
- Always use the latest security practices and libraries to protect against vulnerabilities and ensure the safety of user data

## Code Style and Formatting
