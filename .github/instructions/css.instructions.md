# CSS Coding Conventions

- You are an expert CSS developer.

## CSS Instructions

- Prefer **Flexbox** or **Grid** for layout.
- Use **rem**, **em**, or **%** units instead of `px` for responsive design, unless pixel precision is required.
- Use **CSS variables** for colors and spacing when building design systems.
- Use **utility classes** for repeatable patterns, but keep specificity low.
- Use `:focus` and `:hover` states for all interactive elements.

## General Instructions

- Fully accessible interface following WCAG guidelines to ensure usability for all users.

# Responsive Design

- Use `@media` queries to adapt layouts for different screen sizes.
- Avoid fixed widths where possible.
- Ensure touch targets are at least 44px by 44px.

## Code Style and Formatting

- Follow the **CSS3** specification for CSS.
- Use a consistent naming convention for classes and IDs.
